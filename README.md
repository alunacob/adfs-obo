# Calling a downstream web API from a web API using Azure AD

In this sample, the native client and simple JavaScript single page application call a web API which then calls another downstream web API after obtaining a token to act On Behalf Of the original user.  The sample uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL.NET) in the native client to obtain a token for the user to call the first web API.  It then uses ADAL.NET in the first web API to get a token to act on behalf of the user to call the second downstream web API.  Both flows use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to obtain the tokens. the single page application uses ADAL.js

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

## How To Run This Sample

To run this sample you will need:
- Visual Studio 2013 or above
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, please see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/) 
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account, so if you signed in to the Azure portal with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-onbehalfof.git`

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are three projects in this sample.  Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant.

To register these projects you can  follow the steps in the paragraphs below. Alternatively you can use a PowerShell script which creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) and modifies the project's configuration files for you. If you want to do use this automation read these instructions [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts.md)

#### Register the TodoListService web API

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
3. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
5. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListService' and select 'Web Application and/or Web API' as the Application Type. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44321`. Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.
8. For the App ID URI, enter https://\<your_tenant_name\>/TodoListService, replacing \<your_tenant_name\> with the name of your Azure AD tenant. 
9. From the Settings menu, choose **Keys** and add a key - select a key duration of either 1 year or 2 years. When you save this page, the key value will be displayed, copy and save the value in a safe location - you will need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio - this key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means, so please record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure Portal.

NOTE:  In this sample, the TodoListService makes a delegated identity call to the Graph API to read the user's profile.  By default, when the TodoListService is registered with Active Directory, it is configured to request this permission in the "Required Permissions" configuration section.  If you modify the TodoListService to call a different API, or if you build your own service that makes an On Behalf Of call, the service it calls and the permissions it requires must be added to the "Required Permissions" configuration in Azure AD.

#### Register the TodoListClient app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
3. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
5. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListClient-DotNet' and select 'Native' as the Application Type. For the redirect URI, enter `https://TodoListClient`. Please note that the Redirect URI will not be used in this sample, but it needs to be defined nonetheless. Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.
8. Configure Permissions for your application - in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section, click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type 'TodoListService' in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select 'Access TodoListService'.
 
#### [Optionally] Register the TodoListSPA app

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
3. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
5. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListSPA' and select 'Web Application and/or Web API' as the Application Type. For the redirect URI, enter `http://localhost:16969/`. Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.
9. Enable the OAuth 2 implicit grant for your application by choosing **Manifest** at the top of the application's page, and open the inline manifest editor. Search for the ``oauth2AllowImplicitFlow`` property. You will find that it is set to ``false``; change it to ``true`` and click on Save to save the manifest.
10. Configure Permissions for your application - in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section, click on **Add**, then **Select an API**, and type 'TodoListService' in the textbox. Then, click on  **Select Permissions** and select 'Access TodoListService'.


#### Configure known client applications
For the middle tier web API to be able to call the downstream web API, the user must grant the middle tier permission to do so in the form of consent.  Because the middle tier has no interactive UI of its own, you need to explicitly bind the client app registration in Azure AD with the registration for the web API, which merges the consent required by both the client & middle tier into a single dialog. You can do so by adding the "Client ID" of the client app, to the manifest of the web API in the `knownClientApplications` property. Here's how:

1. Navigate to your 'TodoListService' app registration, and open the manifest editor.
2. In the manifest, locate the `knownClientApplications` array property, and add the Client ID of your client application as an element.  Your code should look like the following after you're done:
    `"knownClientApplications": ["94da0930-763f-45c7-8d26-04d5938baab2"]`
3. Save the TodoListService manifest by clicking the "Save" button.
4. [Optionally] do the same with the ClientID of your single page JavaScript application if you enabled it.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

#### Configure the TodoListService project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Open the `web.config` file.
3. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
4. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the value with the App ID URI you registered earlier, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.
5. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListService from the Azure portal.
6. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the value with the key for the TodoListService from the Azure portal.

#### Configure the TodoListClient project

1. Open `app.config`
2. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
3. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListClient from the Azure portal.
4. Find the app key `ida:RedirectUri` and replace the value with the Redirect URI for the TodoListClient from the Azure portal, for example `http://TodoListClient`.
5. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the value with the  App ID URI of the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`
6. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the value with the base address of the TodoListService project.

#### [Optionnaly] Configure the TodoListSPA project
If you have configured the TodoListSPA application in Azure AD, you want to update the JavaScript project:
1. Open `appconfig.js`.
2. In the `config`variable (which is about the Azure AD TodoListSPA configuration):
 - find the member named `tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
 - find the member named `clientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListSPA application from the Azure portal.
3. In the  `WebApiConfig`variable (which is about configuration of the resource, that is the TodoListService):
 - find the member named `resourceId` and replace the value with the  App ID URI of the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.

### Step 4:  Trust the IIS Express SSL certificate
> this step is no longer necessary with recent versions of Visual Studio.

Since the web API is SSL protected, the client of the API (the web app) will refuse the SSL connection to the web API unless it trusts the API's SSL certificate.  Use the following steps in Windows Powershell to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate.  You only need to do this once.  If you fail to do this step, calls to the TodoListService will always throw an unhandled exception where the inner exception message is:

"The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."

To configure your computer to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate, begin by opening a Windows Powershell command window as Administrator.

Query your personal certificate store to find the thumbprint of the certificate for `CN=localhost`:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\My


    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\My


Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042  CN=localhost
```

Next, add the certificate to the Trusted Root store:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> $cert = (get-item cert:\LocalMachine\My\C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store = (get-item cert:\Localmachine\Root)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Open("ReadWrite")
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Add($cert)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Close()
```

You can verify the certificate is in the Trusted Root store by running this command:

`PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`

### Step 5:  Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it. You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects, or the three projects, as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

Explore the sample by signing in, adding items to the To Do list, removing the user account, and starting again.  The To Do list service will take the user's access token, received from the client, and use it to get another access token so it can act On Behalf Of the user in the Graph API.  This sample does not cache the user's access token at the To Do list service, so it requests a new access token on every request.  The service could cache the access token in a database, for example, for better performance, and it could cache the refresh token so that it could obtain access tokens for the user even when the user is not present.

[Optionally], when you have added a few items with the TodoList Client, login to the todoListSPA with the same credentials as the todoListClient, and observe the id-Token, and the content of the Todo List as stored on the service, but as JSon. This will help you understand the information circulating on the network.

## How To Recreate This Sample

First, in Visual Studio 2013 create an empty solution to host the  projects.  Then, follow these steps to create each project.

### Creating the TodoListService Project

1. In the solution, create a new ASP.Net MVC web API project called TodoListService and while creating the project, click the Change Authentication button, select Organizational Accounts, Cloud - Single Organization, enter the name of your Azure AD tenant, and set the Access Level to Single Sign On.  You will be prompted to sign-in to your Azure AD tenant.  NOTE:  You must sign-in with a user that is in the tenant; you cannot, during this step, sign-in with a Microsoft account.
2. Add the pre-release Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, version 2.6.1-alpha (or higher), to the project.
3. In the `Models` folder add a new class called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoItem from this sample into the class.
4. In the `Models` folder add a new class called `UserProfile.cs`.  Copy the implementation of UserProfile from this sample into the class.
5. Add a new, empty, Web API 2 controller called `TodoListController`.
6. Copy the implementation of the TodoListController from this sample into the controller.  Don't forget to add the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class.
7. In `TodoListController` resolving missing references by adding `using` statements for `System.Collections.Concurrent`, `TodoListService.Models`, `System.Security.Claims`.
9. In `web.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, and `ida:AppKey`,and set them accordingly.  For the public Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.windows.net/{0}`.
8. In `web.config`, in `<appSettings>`, create keys for `ida:GraphResourceId` and `ida:GraphUserUrl` and set the values accordingly.  For the public Azure AD, the value of `ida:GraphResourceId` is `https://graph.windows.net`, and the value of `ida:GraphUserUrl` is `https://graph.windows.net/{0}/me?api-version=2013-11-08`.

### Creating the TodoListClient Project

1. In the solution, create a new Windows --> WPF Application called TodoListClient.
2. Add the (stable) Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, version 1.0.3 (or higher) to the project.
3. Add  assembly references to `System.Net.Http`, `System.Web.Extensions`, and `System.Configuration`.
4. Add a new class to the project called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
5. Add a new class to the project called `CacheHelper.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
6. Add a new class to the project called `CredManCache.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
7. Copy the markup from `MainWindow.xaml' in the sample project into the file of same name in the new project, completely replacing the markup in the file in the new project.
8. Copy the code from `MainWindow.xaml.cs` in the sample project into the file of same name in the new project, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
9. In `app.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, `ida:RedirectUri`, `todo:TodoListResourceId`, and `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and set them accordingly.  For the public Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.windows.net/{0}`.

Finally, in the properties of the solution itself, set both projects as startup projects.
